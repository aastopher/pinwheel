I have the stride of a gazelle. A beautiful gazelle person.
"No hesitation, no surrender, no man left behind."
I do backflips every single day of my life
I feel like if I had that kinda mobility I'd be capable of anything.
You look like an egg with legs
"Science is a liar, sometimes"
What is that a jar of?
"I eat stickers all the time, dude!"
I’m not Fat. I’m cultivating mass.
Cat in the Wall. Now You’re Talking My Language.
What's your spaghetti policy?
How much cheese is too much cheese?
"So anyway, I started blasting!"
"I will eat your babies, b*tch!"
"Wildcard, b*tches! Yee-haw!"
Bird law in this country is not governed by reason.
Rum ham!
Salt the snail!
Spa… what’s this word spa?
How do hobos fit all of their stuff into a bandana?
I don’t know how many years on this Earth I got left. I’m gonna get real weird with it.
"It’s like when I’m doing good in the game, I’m doing good in life."
Let's say you and I go toe-to-toe on bird law and see who comes out the victor.
We'll get to our hot-plates soon enough.
"Okay, Well... Filibuster"
Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?
When was the last time you drank straight mixer?
"f life hands you lemons, you can gotta cram them down some punk’s throat till he sees yellow."
Stupid science b*tches couldn't even make I more smarter!
I've seen many pigs eat many men...it was a blood bath.
What’s up b*tches! I’m a man cheetah! Wanna do something with this?
Religious stuttering army carnies
"If I found myself getting sick, I would simply say, SICKNESS BE GONE!"
I am untethered and my rage knows no bounds
I am a golden god!
I have to have my tools!
"Have you ever been in a storm, Wally?"
Do you have some sort of donkey-brain database? 
"although I seem relaxed, I'm actual incredibly tense at all times!"
you showed a lot of balls stealing my money. That shows leadership. I’m promoting you to manager.
"Then I’ll just regress, ‘cause I feel like I’ve made myself perfectly redundant."
"Oh sh*t! Look at that door, dude. See that door there? The one marked pirate? You think a pirate lives in there?"
I've been poisoned by my constituents!
You gotta pay the troll toll
The trash man!
"I'll tell you what, let me pop a quick H on the box. This way we'll all know it's full of hornets."
Cover your knees up if you're gonna be walking around everywhere.
"I'm chopping all of my action, and mostly power."
We can burn the trash and let that smoke go up into the sky and become stars
All of my instincts and my training tell me to use this as a weapon.
"People like us, we don’t get got. We go get."
"Start breakin’ bricks, wet nips!"
"I think the problem here is that your body quit. Your bird quit. And, unfortunately, it’s no longer legit"
Do not plug an open wound with trash.
You keep using this word jabroni. And…it’s awesome!
